        <p>The submission leads to the project page. It is titled 'client project 2'.</p>
        <p>There is one upper case letter in the file name, using camelcase. It is listed as clientProject2.</p>
        <p>The site has a very readable and basic design but could use more centering. Fonts are easy to read and colors are nice and contrasted. This site follows most of the CRAP principles, other than alignment.</p>
        <p>This site offers a header, footer, and a main.</p>
        <p>Header contains an h1, but is not named as the client. (Lion Landscaping)</p>
        <p>Main starts with an h2.</p>
        <p>Page has a brand tag-line but no slogan. (Elegant Whale)</p>
        <p>Page has footer with menu, and CSS and HTML validations.</p>
        <p>Page covers requirements for assignment. Only other issue is spelling mistakes are present.</p>
